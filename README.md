### original repo <https://github.com/blitzarx1/egui_graphs>  
The homework is located in examples/myproject which is a totally bad project I think.  

### how to run this homework?    

```bash
cd examples/myproject
cargo run -- "the url you want to enter"   
```
It seems that my code becomes worse and worse when I do some work with gui.       


不会真的有人会从大作业的链接点进来吧(；′⌒`)
